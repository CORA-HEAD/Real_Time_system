# Real-Time Queue Display System

This project is a **real-time queue display system** with two interfaces:

1. **Viewer Screen** – For displaying the current queue or status updates in real time.
2. **Admin Screen** – For managing and updating the queue in real time.

The system is built using **React** for frontend and **Socket.IO / WebSocket** for real-time communication.
